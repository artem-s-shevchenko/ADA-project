For each brand we delete categories which are not connected with products which company from Switzerland produces. E.g. Swiss company \"Omega\" makes mainly watches or similar accessories. Therefore, product in category ['Home & Kitchen','Kitchen & Dining', 'Small Appliances', 'Juicers', 'Masticating Juicers'] is very likely not swiss product. We checked manualy some products and actual brands of such categories, to justify our assumptions."

    "At this point it is significant to explain how we calculate mean rating of group of reviews (group of reviews for one category, brand, product, etc.). Most logical solution would be to just take average value of those ratings. However, we soon realise that is not very precise solution. E.g. if we calculate average rating for one product, find that product and compare ratings we will in most cases find noticable difference. Therefore, we decided to use field \"helpful\" in order to make better estimation of mean rating (field helpful is a string \"positive/total\", which says how many people rated that review as helpful). Therefore, we took each rating with some weight. If both values \"positive\" and \"total\" are non-zero then we take that rating with weight positive/negative (e.g. for 1/4 we calculate 0.25\\*rating). In case value \"positive\" is 0 and value total is non-zero we calculate weight as 2/(2+total) (e.g. for 0/2 we calculate 0.5\\*rating). The goal was to avoid taking rating with score 0/1 and rating with score 0/10 with same weights, cause they are certainly not the same. Moreover, ratings with score 0/0 (majority of reviews is unrated) we decided to take with weight 1 (e.g. 1\\*rating). We empiricaly deduces that this weight gives most realistic results.  "

Moreover, products will also be sorted by number of reviews. Meaning that products with more reviews will be sorted before products with same mean rating but less reviews. Of course, we are more sure about mean rating if we have more reviews. Therefore, on the first place will be our best product (with biggest rating and most reviews). When we are looking for worst product things are a little bit more complicated. By empirical observation we spoted that rating for products which have only one review is very unreliable (when compared to rating of that product on amazon.com). Hence, for worse product we will take product with smallest rating but which have at least 2 reviews. If a product have only 2 reviews and both are with low rating, we can conclude with much bigger certainty that rating of that product is low. "

Reason is that there are currently almost 300 reviews for this product, and apparently, after the point our data was collected, a lot of people, unexpectedly, rated product very good. We tried to resolve some of similar situations and draw best conclusions out of given data. However, due to changing data we should take results with a grain of salt.  \n",
